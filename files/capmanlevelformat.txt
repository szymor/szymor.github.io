CAPMAN LEVEL FORMAT (612 bytes):
	504 (21 x 24) bytes - level data (empty tiles, walls, mines)
		1 byte per tile
		every row (21 tiles) lies one after another in a file - level data is grouped by rows
		byte values have following values:
			00 empty tile (no capsule)
			01 upper left corner wall
			02 horizontal wall
			03 upper right corner wall
			04 vertical wall
			05 lower right wall
			06 lower left wall
			07 upper wall
			08 right wall
			09 lower wall
			0A left wall
			0B upside-down T wall
			0C |- wall
			0D T wall
			0E -| wall
			0F + wall
			10 tile with a capsule
			11 tile with a weird black thing (wall-like tile)
			12 tile with a weird red thing (wall-like tile)
			14 tile with a mine
			other values are pitch black tiles which work like a wall
	72 bytes - position of players, bug startpoint, bonuses
		position numbers are 32-bit (probably unsigned) little-endian integers, X position as first, Y position as second:
			player 1
			player 2
			player 3
			player 4
			bug startpoint
			bonus point 1
			bonus point 2
			bonus point 3
			bonus point 4
		player and bonus point positions should not contain X or Y coordinate equal 0 - it causes that such a player or bonus is invisible, the player cannot play and the bonus cannot be caught, this bug (or feature) could be used to make a level for a certain number of players or to set up fewer bonus points
	3 bytes - amount of bugs - overall amount of bugs MUST NOT be greater than 24 - otherwise the game will crash, probably somewhere in the game code there is a static array with 24 bug objects (or sth similar)
		first byte - amount of red bugs
		second byte - amount of yellow bugs
		third byte - amount of blue bugs
	33 bytes - title of the level - ASCII characters only, it need not to be null terminated (but it can be), the title should be not longer than 30 characters - longer strings are displayed out of frame
